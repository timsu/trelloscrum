An extension that counts points on trello cards.

Inspired by OGD's enhancements for Trello:
[BUS-OGD/OGDs-enhancements-for-Trello](https://github.com/BUS-OGD/OGDs-enhancements-for-Trello)

 * Create section headers with *** or #
 * Expands labels for all cards
 * Shows # of story points in headers (each card is assumed to carry 1 story point)
 * To customize the story point value of a card, append (#) - e.g. (3)
